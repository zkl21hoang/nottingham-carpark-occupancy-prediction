# Data Science Project: Predicting Carpark Occupancy by Time-series Models

+ This data science project aimed to analyze and assess the dataset of Nottingham car parks to prepare and train the time-series prediction model for two car park locations in Nottingham.
+ We used various types of Python library for data science such as pmdarima, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, sklearn, scipy, pylab and tensorflow with the help of Google Colab platform to explore, clean, and visualize the dataset. After that, we move to the assessment part, which uses autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation methods to reinforce the thesis of the time-series trend of data. The final part is to build and train the prediction model. To generate the future prediction of the car park occupancy rate, we used two models: TensorFlow-LSTM and Seasonal ARIMA. The final outcome of the developed models has the accuracy around 93%-94%.Â

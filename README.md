# Data Science Project: Carpark Occupancy Time-series Prediction Model

+ This data science project aimed to analyze and assess the dataset of Nottingham car parks, with the goal of preparing and training the time-series prediction model for two car park locations in Nottingham. 
+ We used the Python library for data science with the Google Colab platform to explore, clean, and visualize the dataset. After that, we move to the assessment part, which used autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation methods to reinforce the thesis of the time-series trend of data. The final part is to build and train the prediction model. To generate the future prediction of carpark occupancy rate, we used two models (TensorFlow-LSTM and Seasonal ARIMA), with a final accuracy of 93%-94%.

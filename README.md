# Data Science Project: Carpark Occupancy Time-series Prediction Model

+ This Data Science Project aimed to analyze the dataset of Nottingham carpark and took an assessment through
the dataset to choose two carpark which should be used to prepare and train for time-series prediction model.
+ At first, we used python library for data science with Google Colab platform to explore, clean and visualize the
dataset. After that, we move to the assessment part that used Auto Correlation and Partial Auto Correlation
methods to reinforce the thesis of time-series trend of data. Final part is to build and train the prediction
model. Here we preferred to use 2 models (TensorFlow â€“ LSTM) and (Seasonal ARIMA) to generate the future
prediction of carpark occupancy rate (93 - 94% Accuracy).

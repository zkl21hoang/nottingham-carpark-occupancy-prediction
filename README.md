# Data Science Project: Carpark Occupancy Time-series Prediction Model

+ This Data Science Project aimed to analyze the dataset of Nottingham carpark and took an assessment through the dataset along with the goal to prepare and train the time-series prediction model for 2 carpark locations in Nottingham.
+ We used python library for data science with Google Colab platform to explore, clean and visualize the dataset. After that, we move to the assessment part that used Auto Correlation and Partial Auto Correlation methods to reinforce the thesis of time-series trend of data. The final part is to build and train the prediction
model. We used 2 models (TensorFlow â€“ LSTM) and (Seasonal ARIMA) to generate the future prediction of carpark occupancy rate which has the final accuracy around 93% - 94%
